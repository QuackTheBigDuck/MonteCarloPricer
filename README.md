# MonteCarloPricer

MonteCarloPricer is a project dedicated to implementing pricing models using Monte Carlo simulations. This repository includes tools and algorithms for financial modeling and option pricing.

## Features

- Efficient Monte Carlo simulation techniques.
- Extensible framework for adding more pricing models.
- Focus on accuracy and performance.

## Installation

To use the MonteCarloPricer, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuackTheBigDuck/MonteCarloPricer.git
```

Navigate into the repository directory:

```bash
cd MonteCarloPricer
```

Install the required dependencies (if any):

```bash
# Example for Python projects
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Configure your simulation parameters in the relevant file.
2. Run the main script to execute the Monte Carlo simulation.
3. View the results generated by the simulation.

Example:

```bash
python main.py
```
